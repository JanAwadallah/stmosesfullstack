            As we continue to celebrate the Joy of the Resurrection, we must
            understand that this is not the only time we recognise it. The
            Resurrection must be lived by all of us, at all times within us.
            From the moment we wake up to the time we go to sleep. The
            Resurrection is more than just a once a year event, it is an action,
            a way of life and a daily presence in our lives. It is not just
            during the Resurrection period only.
          </p>

            The Joy of the Resurrection extends and radiates throughout our
            church, and should be extended into our homes, and amongst our
            families and loved ones. When we live this Joy through our feasts,
            and fasts throughout the church year, attending the liturgy and
            partake in communion we experience the joy of the Resurrection.

            When we pray our daily matins prayer, they serve as a reminder of
            the Resurrection, as we say: “With your light, O Lord, we see the
            light”; And every Sunday we celebrate this day that the Lord has
            made.

            In the Agpeya prayer of the 6th Hour, which is the prayer of the
            cross, we pray saying, “We thank you O Lord for you have filled us
            all with Joy, O Saviour, when you came to help the world. Glory be
            to you, O Lord. This means to be full. It is as if each one of us
            goes to the foot of the cross, stands there and prays: “Lord, here
            is my heart, fill it,” and the Lord fills the heart with the Love of
            the Lord.

            “Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say, rejoice!”
            Philippians 4:4 The message behind this verse is that we should all
            rejoice together, as one group, one community- To rejoice at all
            times; pray always and to give thanks always. The relationship
            between praying always, giving thanks always, and rejoicing always
            should be like a braid or rope. ‘A three-fold cord that is entwined
            to give it strength’ “a cord of three strands is not quickly broken”
            Eccl 4:12.
